Are you a nerd who can't decide whether of not to go to prom? Fear not! Let this simple Python script decide for you!

Steps to run:
  - Install Python 3 if you do not have it already. (https://python.org)
  - Download this repo. (git clone or use the zip file)
  - If using the zip file, extract it.
  - Enter your extracted or cloned folder.
  - Run ```python3 prom-decider.py``` or ```python prom-decider``` depending on your OS. (Most likely the first of the two)

If this repo gets 1,000 stars, I'll make an app to help you choose who to ask. :D
